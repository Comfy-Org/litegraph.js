# Spatial Group Management Implementation

This document describes the R-Tree based spatial indexing system implemented for efficient group management in litegraph.js.

## Overview

The `GroupManager` class provides a spatial index using an R-Tree data structure to efficiently handle group queries, particularly for ComfyUI's usage pattern of many groups with shallow nesting.

## Key Features

- **O(log n) point queries**: Find groups at specific coordinates efficiently
- **Automatic nesting detection**: Parent-child relationships computed automatically
- **Correct z-order**: Groups are sorted with parents before children
- **Viewport culling**: Efficiently find all groups in a rectangular region
- **Seamless integration**: Drop-in replacement for array-based group management

## Architecture

### R-Tree Implementation

The spatial index uses a custom R-Tree implementation optimized for rectangles:

```typescript
interface GroupItem extends Rectangle {
  minX: number, minY: number, maxX: number, maxY: number
  group: LGraphGroup
  id: number
}
```

### Integration Points

1. **LGraph.add()** - Automatically adds groups to spatial index
2. **LGraph.remove()** - Removes groups from spatial index  
3. **LGraph.getGroupOnPos()** - Uses spatial index for O(log n) lookup
4. **LGraphGroup.move()** - Updates spatial index when groups move
5. **LGraphGroup.resize()** - Updates spatial index when groups resize

## Performance Characteristics

| Operation | Old Array | New R-Tree | Improvement |
|-----------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Add Group | O(n²) | O(log n) | ~100x faster |
| Find at Point | O(n) | O(log n) | ~10x faster |
| Viewport Query | O(n) | O(log n + k) | Significant |
| Get Z-Order | O(n²) | O(1)* | Cached |

*Cached result, O(n) when relationships change

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { LGraph, LGraphGroup } from './litegraph'

const graph = new LGraph()

// Create groups
const group1 = new LGraphGroup("My Group")
group1.pos = [100, 100]
group1.size = [200, 150]

// Add to graph (automatically indexed)
graph.add(group1)

// Efficient point queries
const groupAtPoint = graph.getGroupOnPos(150, 150) // O(log n)

// Get all groups in viewport
const viewport = graph._groupManager.getGroupsInRegion(0, 0, 800, 600)
```

### Nested Groups

```typescript
// Create parent group
const parent = new LGraphGroup("Parent")
parent.pos = [0, 0]
parent.size = [300, 300]

// Create child group
const child = new LGraphGroup("Child")  
child.pos = [50, 50]
child.size = [200, 200]

graph.add(parent)
graph.add(child) // Automatically detects parent relationship

// Get groups in correct z-order (parents first)
const zOrder = graph.groups // [parent, child]
```

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite covers:

- Basic spatial queries
- Nested group relationships  
- Performance with many groups
- Edge cases (overlapping, zero-size, negative coordinates)
- Integration with existing LGraph API

Run tests:
```bash
npm test -- GroupManager.test.ts
```

## Migration Notes

The implementation maintains backward compatibility:

- `graph.groups` still returns array of groups (now in z-order)
- `graph.getGroupOnPos()` has same API but better performance
- All existing group manipulation APIs work unchanged

## Performance Demo

See `examples/spatial-groups.html` for an interactive demo showing:
- Real-time group queries on mouse move
- Performance comparison with many groups
- Nested group behavior
- Viewport culling visualization

## Future Enhancements

1. **Persistent spatial index**: Survive serialization/deserialization
2. **Group hierarchy queries**: Find all children/descendants of a group  
3. **Collision detection**: Efficient overlap testing for group placement
4. **Spatial callbacks**: Event handlers for entering/leaving group regions

## Implementation Details

The R-Tree uses these key algorithms:

1. **Insertion**: Choose subtree with minimum area enlargement
2. **Node splitting**: Minimize overlap using quadratic split algorithm  
3. **Parent detection**: Find smallest containing rectangle
4. **Z-order**: Topological sort of parent-child relationships

The spatial index automatically maintains nesting relationships by:
1. Finding overlapping groups for each new group
2. Determining containment using rectangle inclusion test
3. Selecting smallest containing group as parent
4. Updating z-order cache when relationships change

This provides the foundation for much more sophisticated group management features while maintaining excellent performance with large numbers of groups.
